# whs_robotic_designlab

Okay. I am bad at writing, so you will soon find out, but here are the somewhat cohesive instructions for using this code.

## First:
Clone the repo.
If you don't know what that means, blame ECS.

## Second:
Now that you have the code downloaded, I should probably explain what it does and where everything is.
  - [Libraries](https://github.com/goatfanboi23/whs_robotic_designlab/tree/master/Libraries) This is where you will find the dependencies for your project.
  It is not important to note that I coded these (except for PS2X_LIB).
  - [BattleBot](https://github.com/goatfanboi23/whs_robotic_designlab/tree/master/BattleBot) This is the code for the battlebot (2022-2023). By no means is it perfect.
  In fact, I purposely (definitely on purpose) didn't code arcade drive so you guys would have something to do this year.
  Luckily, I did in fact make it super easy to code arcade drive (don't tell the teacher). All you have to do is ![image](https://i.ibb.co/N92thRv/Screenshot-2023-01-14-173945-75-1-25.png)
  - Seriously though, I did all the hard work for you. For example, you need to know the RPM of a motor just call `motor.getRPM();` 
  Need to execute some code when a button is pressed, just added it to the `buttonFunction` array. 
  ## Third
  I highly recommend you *READ* the [BattleBot Code](https://github.com/goatfanboi23/whs_robotic_designlab/blob/master/BattleBot/BattleBot.ino).
  I have provided comments, that hopefully will help in understanding what I wrote and how to use different functionality of my code.
  ## Forth
  I realized this isn't a list and just a place for me to dump random information. If you're still reading, Thanks!
  Here is a quick tip that will give you and edge. Learn on Object Oriented Programming Language(OOP).
  I will admit C/C++ is hard.<br> Memory Management, no thanks. Call by value or call by Reference, Why would I know. 
  Start with something simple like Java (python is dog water) that probably won't age well. 
  Anyway, it is much easier to learn the fundamentals of OOP in a simpler language than to jump head first into arduino, a C++/C weird hybrid.
  I understand that doesn't help you because odds are you don't have time to *Learn Java*. You need to code whatever heck the instructor wants you to do **NOW**.
  In that case....
  1. [BOOM](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/arduino/index.htm)
  2. [BANG](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/Blink)
  3. [BANG AGAIN](https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/digital/Button)
  Also have fun wiring :)
